# Iris-ML-Lab

# Task 1 – Loading and Visualization
Load the Iris dataset from a CSV file into numpy, convert class labels to numerical values, and create a scatter plot for the first two features (sepal length vs. sepal width).

# Task 2 – Visualizing Feature Combinations
Generate a grid of scatter plots showing all possible feature combinations, with colors representing different classes. Add axis labels and a legend.

# Task 3 – Classification Using Centroids
Reduce the dataset to two features (petal length and petal width), compute centroids for each class, and classify a new sample based on the nearest centroid using Euclidean distance.
